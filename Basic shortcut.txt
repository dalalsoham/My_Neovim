If you want to paste anything in the vim editor you need to set the paste mode .

Process:
========
1. Press the "esc" then write ":set paste" and "enter"
2. After that, press the "shift + right click" to paste the whole copy thing that you are copying.

For run command and some instructions:
--------------------------------------

1. To insert the neovim we need to tap the "i" for insert the text editor.

2. For exit the file you need to write this command "esc :q"
(Using the esc option you can leave the any mode that you are currently using.)

3. For open any file use the neovim command then file name and file type (example: neovim app.c)

4. To run the ".c" file we need to write "esc" (:!gcc -o FileName % && FileName)

5. To save the any file you need to write (esc :x)
