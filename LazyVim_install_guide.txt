 i. Neovim >= 0.9.0
 ii. Git >= 2.19.0
 iii. For telescope.nvim we need :
  iii.A. live grep: ripgrep(https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
      After visit this link we need to install the "ripgrep". So copt this command line and paste this to your terminal :
      "winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC" (For windows user)
                        OR,
      "scoop install ripgrep" (For windows user)
                        OR,
      "choco install ripgrep" (For windows user)

    And for macOs user :
    "brew install ripgrep"

  iii.B. find files: fd (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
      After visit this link we need to install the "fd". So copy this command line and paste this to your terminal :

    Kitty(For Mac and linux),
    Wezterm(for windows, linux and mac),
    alacritty(for windows, linux and mac),
    iterm2 (MacOs)

    In this above install any one of then according to your Machine and Os
    
    My own suggestion is -> Wezterm (https://github.com/wez/wezterm)
    Or go to this official website : https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/install/windows.html (This is download link for windows user)

    I prefered that install this via terminal. Don't install the any Zip file or exe file.

    Follow this process to install the wezterm using the terminal :
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    1. winget install wez.wezterm
    2. winget upgrade wez.wezterm
    And for scoop users:
    1. scoop bucket add extras
    2. scoop install wezterm
    And for choco users:
    1. choco install wezterm -y

 v. The file thing is we need to install Nerd Font into your terminal or system. And the version will be the v3.0 or greater.
   Follow this link and install this : https://www.nerdfonts.com


---> Now install LazyVim with powershell :

1. Make a backup of your current Neovim file :
  -> Move-Item $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim.bak
  -> Move-Item $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data.bak

2. Clone this Repo into your system :
  -> git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
