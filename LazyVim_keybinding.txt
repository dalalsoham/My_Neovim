Some basic keybinding for the LazyVim :
=======================================
"LEADER" KEY IS THE "SPACE" KEY .

1. nvim command of the open the neovim in the powershell or the cmd or the wezterm.

2. "nvim ." is for open the all file in the set path, that I am active on.

3. "space e" for the sidenav open and hide .

4. "esc :q" for quite the editor or the window.

5. "esc :wq" write and save and also quite the current window.

6. "esc :w" for normal save file . Also you use the ctri+s for the save.

7. for file rename : "r"

8. for file delete : "d"

9.find any file "space ff" and off this window "esc esc"

10. to go bottom of the file "G" and "gg" for go to the top of the file

11. "e" for the go forward per word

12. "0" for go to the first of the line 

13. "$" for go to the last of the line

14.  ":" and "%s/one word that you want to replace or original word/the new word/g"

ex: 
app.post("/sub", () => {

  })

app.post("/sub", () => {

  })

Now here i want to replace the "app.post" word with the "app.get" so i write the command: 

: for open a window then "%s/app.post/app.get/g"
